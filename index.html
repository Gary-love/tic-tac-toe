               <p>Welcome to tic-tac-toe:</p> 
              <p> Game Setup:
                There are two players, player 1 will be X and Player 2 will be O</p>
                <p>  - The goal is to be the first player to get three of your symbols in a row. This can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
                <p>  - The game board is divided into nine squares, and players take turns placing their symbols on the board.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Rules:
                    <p> 1. Starting the Game: player 1 starts first.</p>
                    <p>  2. Taking Turns: Players alternate turns, placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty square on the grid.</p>
                    <p> 3. Winning: A player wins if they place three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</p>
                    <p> 4. Draw: If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.</p>
                    <p> 5. Invalid Moves: Players cannot place their symbol in a square that is already occupied.</p>
